        <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I am a 14 year old residing in Medfield, Massachusetts. I have no prior paid work experience but, there are many things that will make me a valuable asset to the company.  First off, I am a <em>strong</em>  and <em>confident</em> leader.  I work well both independently and with others.  I work hard -- and when I am faced with a challenge, I conquer it.  Lastly, I will always complete a task to the best of my ability, without question. 
        </p>
