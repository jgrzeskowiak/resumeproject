        <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I am a 14 year old residing in Medfield, Massachusetts. I have no prior paid work experience but, there are many things that will make me a valuable asset to the company.  First off, I am a <em>strong</em>  and <em>confident</em> leader.  I work well both independently and with others.  I work hard -- and when I am faced with a challenge, I conquer it.  Lastly, I will always complete a task to the best of my ability, without question. 
        </p>
        <h1>Education/Academics</h1>
           <p>I am currently in the 9th grade.  I began my schooling in Staten Island, New York.  I went to Our Lady Help of Christians School, up until the 3rd grade.  I have been in the Medfield Public School System since.  Over the past 6 years, I have acquired many achievements and experience.  I have consistently maintained good grades in school.  I enjoy learning and challenging myself academically.  I particularly enjoy the sciences and mathematics.  I was an honors biology student this year and am going to be an honor physics student next year.  I have also taken a computer science and culinary class to expand upon what I believe to be necessary skills for someone my age.  My leadership qualities are also recognized and used in the school environment.  I was selected by the principal of Medfield High School, through recommendation of previous teachers and staff, to be on his student-led advisory board.  I am joined by 2 classmates and 3 students from each of the other grades above me.  I will hold this position for all 4 of my years at Medfield High School.  

I plan to continue to pursue academic excellence and expand my knowledge and love for learning whenever possible.
